I acknowledge that the authors have largely addressed my comments in a satisfactory manner. The only exception is that I still find the claim of "clear HLE evidence" in the second line of the second paragraph of section 4 and in the sixth line of section 6. All we have is consistency with the HLE scaling, as the reply letter acknowledges, and the text should not contain much bolder statements. Other than that I do not see any reason why the manuscript should not be published.

We changed the tone of the manuscript. Thank you again for your kind suggestions.
